# Handwritten Digit Recognition
The Handwritten Digit Recognition system is a data science project designed to accurately classify handwritten digits from the MNIST dataset using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). This application leverages Python and TensorFlow/Keras to build, train, and evaluate a robust model capable of achieving high accuracy in digit recognition.
